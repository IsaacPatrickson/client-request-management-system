#  **Client Request Management System**

### Django • Docker • PostgreSQL • Render • Agile • TDD

A full-stack **Client Request Management System (CRMS)** built with **Django**, **Docker**, and **PostgreSQL**, designed to help technical teams track client requests with clear visibility across clients, request types, and statuses.

This project was created as part of an Agile, Sprint-based workflow and demonstrates practical use of:

* Django models, admin customisation, and auth
* Role-based permissions (admin vs limited users)
* Dockerised local development
* PostgreSQL in production (Render)
* Automated testing with pytest + pytest-django
* Custom management commands
* Deployment workflow on Render
* Technical documentation and system design
* Scrum practices, Jira sprint boards & Agile diaries

📄 Full technical write-up (architecture, Agile analysis, sprint boards, TDD rationale) is located in:
**`/docs/Client_Request_Management_System_WriteUp.docx`** 

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

The Client Request Management System is a lightweight web application built to solve a real problem: **client requests were being missed due to poor visibility and inconsistent tracking**.

This system provides:

* A dashboard for managing clients, request types, and client requests
* Inline viewing of related request records
* Role-based access:

  * **Admins** → full CRUD
  * **Limited users** → create, read, update (but no deletion)
* A clean login and registration interface
* A secure, scalable deployment pipeline through Docker → Render

This project was developed using **Scrum**, divided into epics and user stories, with documented sprint boards, Agile diary entries and TDD cycles included in the write-up.

---

## ✨ **Key Features**

### 🔐 Authentication & Permissions

* Custom user roles (Admin, Limited User)
* Limited users can manage requests but **cannot delete**
* Newly registered users default to limited permissions
* Account-disabled redirection for non-staff roles

### 📁 Request Tracking

* Manage:

  * Clients
  * Request Types
  * Client Requests
* Inline related objects within the Django admin UI
* Status flow: **Pending → In Progress → Completed**

### 🛠 Developer Experience

* **Full Docker environment**
* **Makefile** to streamline commands
* **Automated test suite** (pytest + coverage)
* **Management commands**: seeding, wiping data

### ☁️ Deployment

* Hosted on **Render**
* PostgreSQL production database
* Static files via WhiteNoise
* Gunicorn as WSGI server

This project includes a Makefile so you can manage Django + Docker without long commands:

```bash
make <command>
```

## ⚙️ **Setup & Development**

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IsaacPatrickson/client-request-management-system.git
cd client-request-management-system
```

### 2. Build the Docker environment

```bash
make build
```

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
make up
```

### 4. Apply migrations & load seed data

```bash
make makemigrations
make migrate
make exampledata
```

### 5. Collect static files

```bash
make collectstatic
```

Access the app at:
**[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)**

---

## 🗄 **Management Commands**

### Wipe the database

```bash
make flush
```

### Seed example data

```bash
make exampledata
```

---

## 🧪 **Testing**

Run the full pytest suite:

```bash
make test
```

Run with coverage:

```bash
make coverage
```

Generate an HTML report:

```bash
docker-compose exec web pytest --cov=main --cov-report=html
```

The test suite includes:

* Form validation tests
* Registration tests
* Authentication and permission tests
* Model behaviour
* Dashboard and CRUD behaviour

All TDD details and screenshots are included in the write-up.

## 🚀 Deployment (Render – Previously Hosted)

This application was deployed to a live production environment using **Render**, running inside a Docker container with a managed **PostgreSQL** database.

Although the live deployment is no longer active, the setup and configuration demonstrate the full production workflow:

### Deployment Workflow

1. Updated `requirements.txt` for production (`psycopg2` instead of `psycopg2-binary`)
2. Configured environment variables in Render (secrets, DB URL, debug mode)
3. Ran migrations against the hosted PostgreSQL instance
4. Collected static files:

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

5. Built and deployed through Render’s Docker environment
6. Served the application using **Gunicorn** and **WhiteNoise**

This setup reflects a real-world Django deployment pipeline with containerisation and cloud hosting.
